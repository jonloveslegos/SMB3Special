------------------------------ SUPER MARIO MAKER NPC PACK ------------------------------

This NPC pack adds 9 new NPCs, appearing from Super Mario Maker and the sequel, Super
Mario Maker 2, and this readme file will now introduce you to the NPCs included in this
pack.

==== ICICLES ===========================================================================
Icicles act the same as its appearance in Super Mario Maker 2. There are three variants,
with one made completely for this pack, and the rest are from Super Mario Maker 2.

Light blue Icicles are a type of icicles that can fall down either when the player is
near, or when the player stepped on it. It will break once it reaches the ground.

Pale blyue Icicles (with rocks on the bottom) are a type of icicles that can fall down
when the player is near, or when the player stepped on it, just like the Light blue
variations. However, it won't break once it reaches the ground, and can be used as a
platform.

Dark blue Icicles (with rocks on the top) are a type of icicles that sticks to the
ceiling, and will not fall if the player is near or if the player stepped on it.

==== STONE BLOCK =======================================================================
Stone Block are carriable blocks that appears in the Story Mode of Super Mario Maker 2,
and is exclusive to the Story Mode in Super Mario Maker 2. Just like the source game,
Stone Blocks can slow the player down and lowers the player's jump height. It can also
damage the player if it gets to the top of the player.

==== BURNERS ===========================================================================
Burner blocks are finally here, with the same behavior in Super Mario Maker and Super
Mario Maker 2. You can set it to either On or Off, which affects if it will release fire
at the start of the level. And for the upwards-facing Burners, a variation that only
activates when being stepped on is also here, adding variety to the burners.

==== BURNER FIRE =======================================================================
Burner Fire, NPCs that are usually summoned by Burners, can also be placed alone, just
like Dino-Torch's fire. The flames lasted for 256 ticks (4 seconds).

==== CONVINIENT FIREBAR ================================================================
Have you ever set up firebars in your level and thinks "This is a hassle," then this NPC
is made for you! Convinient Firebar makes things easier than ever, with features like
firebar's movement direction, length configured in the extra settings, starting angle
either from 0 to 359 degrees, and orbit amount for quick multiple firebars in one NPC.

==== ANGRY SUN and MOON ================================================================
Angry Sun and the Moon is now in this pack, added in v.1.2! They spin around for a few
times in the left or right side of the screen, and later on does a dive.
