The big coin NPCs have the following properties for NPC configs and npc-n.txt files:


- value
How many coins are granted to the player upon collection.

- collectEffectID
The ID of the effect that is spawned upon collection.

- collectSoundEffect
The sound effect played upon collection. It can be a number for a vanilla sound effect, or a string for a custom one.
