The one-way walls have the following properties for block configs and block-n.txt files:


- direction (Defaults: oneWayWall.DIRECTION_UP, oneWayWall.DIRECTION_RIGHT, oneWayWall.DIRECTION_DOWN, oneWayWall.DIRECTION_LEFT)
The direction that the block faces.

- interactSFX (Default: "oneWayWall_interact.wav")
The sound effect played when interacting with the block. Can be nil for none, a number for a vanilla sound, or a sound effect object/string for a custom sound.
- shakeOnInteraction (Default: true)
Whether or not the block will shake when interacting with an object.
