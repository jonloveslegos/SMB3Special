The NPC Tower can set what NPCs it contains through its extra settings. It should either be a list of IDs, like so:

1, 1, 1, 1

or a table of information, like so:

165, {id = 437,direction = DIR_RIGHT}

The properties that a table can contain are as follows:

id                         The ID of the NPC (required).
count                      How many of this NPC is spawned.

friendly                   Triggers the effects of the "friendly" option in the editor.
dontMove                   Triggers the effects of the "doesn't move" option in the editor.
legacyBoss                 Triggers the effects of the "set as boss" option in the editor.

layerName                  Sets the NPC's "current layer" option in the editor.
attachedLayerName          Sets the NPC's "attach to layer" option in the editor (not to be confused with "layerName").

ai2                        Sets one of the NPC's behaviour-related properties (changes some special properties).
ai3,ai4,ai5                Sets one of the NPC's behaviour-related properties.
                           
direction                  The direction that the NPC is forced to face. Can be DIR_LEFT for left (or up for vertical NPCs) or DIR_RIGHT for right (or down for vertical NPCs).
